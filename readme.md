## ✨ Features

### AI-Assisted Translation Pipeline

The translations on E-Piṭaka are not machine-translated from scratch. They are produced through a careful multi-step process:

1. **Source Gathering** — Existing translations are collected from multiple authoritative sources:
   - 🇬🇧 English: Bhikkhu Bodhi, Anandajoti Bhikkhu, E.B. Cowell, and others
   - 🇱🇰 Sinhala: [tipitaka.lk](https://tipitaka.lk)
   - 🇹🇭 Thai: Mahāmakut Royal Edition
   - 🇲🇲 Myanmar Nissaya (interlinear): [wikipali.org](https://wikipali.org)
   - 🇻🇳 Vietnamese: [tamtangpaliviet.net](https://tamtangpaliviet.net)

2. **Algorithmic Alignment** — Each source is matched to the VRI paragraph structure so the same passage can be compared across languages.

3. **Sentence-Level AI Translation** — For each Pāli sentence, the aligned source translations are sent to an AI language model, which produces a new translation drawing on all sources.

4. **Context Enrichment** — The AI is given rich context including:
   - The relevant **commentary (Aṭṭhakathā)** and **sub-commentary (Ṭīkā)**
   - A **glossary** of key terms and preferred translations
   - **Pāli definitions** from previous translation runs
   - **Translations of preceding sections** for style consistency

5. **Verification Pass** — The AI-generated translation is checked again against the original Pāli to catch misinterpretations.

6. **Human Review** — A human reader reviews results, feeds back corrections, and adjusts the process for the next cycle.

> **These are research translations, not authoritative renderings.** They are meant to help readers engage with the original Pāli more directly. Please do not quote them as final or definitive.

### 📖 Inline Commentaries & Sub-Commentaries

One of the unique features of E-Piṭaka is the ability to read the **Tipiṭaka with its traditional commentaries inline**:

- **Mūla (Root Text)** — The original Pāli Canon (Sutta, Vinaya, Abhidhamma)
- **Aṭṭhakathā (Commentary)** — The traditional explanations by Ven. Buddhaghosa and other commentators
- **Ṭīkā (Sub-Commentary)** — Further elaborations by later scholars

When you read a section, the **M / A / Ṭ buttons** in the top bar track your position and link to the corresponding passage in each layer of the literature. This lets you understand each passage in its full traditional context — something previously requiring multiple books open simultaneously.

### 🔍 Powerful Search

- **Heading Search** — Find sections by their titles
- **Full-Text Search** — Search across all Pāli text and translations
- **Pāli Dictionary** — Look up individual Pāli words with definitions
- **AI Semantic Search** — Find conceptually related passages using AI

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support

Read in multiple languages with the same interface:
- **English** — AI-assisted translations from multiple source traditions
- **Vietnamese** — Translation from tamtangpaliviet.net
- More languages planned

### 📱 Pāli Script Conversion

Read the Pāli text in any major Southeast Asian script:
- Roman (standard)
- Myanmar (Burmese)
- Thai
- Khmer
- Lao
- Sinhala
- Devanagari
- And many more...

### 🎨 Customizable Reading Experience

- **Layout**: Stacked (Pāli above translation) or side-by-side
- **Theme**: Light, dark, or system default
- **Font size**: Adjustable from 10px to 32px
- **Colors**: Customize Pāli and translation text colors
- **Page numbers**: VRI, PTS, Myanmar, or Thai editions

## 🏗️ Architecture

The public website is a **static React app**. Book text is **JSON files**, not SQL. Netlify Functions (free) read those files and serve `/api/menu`, `/api/search`, and `/api/book`.

```
dethana.org/
├── site/                        # React UI (Vite)
│   └── public/data/             # Gzipped JSON (the data store)
├── netlify/functions/           # Free Netlify Functions — no database
├── scripts/export_static.py     # One-time SQLite → JSON on your PC
└── netlify.toml
```

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Public site** | React + Vite (static files) |
| **Data** | JSON files on Netlify’s CDN (no SQL at runtime) |
| **API** | Netlify Functions (menu, search, book sections) |
| **Hosting** | Netlify free / Starter |
| **Local corpora** | SQLite only on your PC, to build the JSON |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+ (only to export the databases into JSON)

### Export data, then run the static site

```bash
# 1. Keep the SQLite files on this computer (they are too large for GitHub):
#    web_server/data/epitaka.db
#    web_server/data/epitaka_en.db

# 2. Turn them into small JSON files for the website
python scripts/export_static.py

# 3. Build and preview the static site
cd site
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/en/`.

### Publish on GitHub → Netlify

1. Run `python scripts/export_static.py` so `site/public/data/` exists.
2. Commit **source + the exported JSON**. Do **not** commit `*.db` or `node_modules`.
3. In Netlify: **Add new site → Import from GitHub**. Leave the base directory empty (repo root). `netlify.toml` builds `site/` and publishes `site/dist`.

There is **no SQL database on Netlify**. Functions read JSON files. The `.db` files never leave your computer.

The Flask app in `web_server/` is optional (translation editor / old VPS).

---

## 📊 Data (JSON, not SQL)

On the website, books are gzipped JSON under `site/public/data/`. SQLite is only used on your machine when you run `python scripts/export_static.py`.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `menu.json` | Library tree |
| `langs.json` | Translation languages |
| `headings.json.gz` | Search index |
| `books/{id}.json.gz` | One book’s Pāli + translation |
